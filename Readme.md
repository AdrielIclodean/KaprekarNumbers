This project is computing all the Kaprekar's numbers and also showing how the sequence is done for every number

The sequence is starting from 9998
This algorithm will filter out values that have the same digits like 9999

Algorithm, will show for every number how many iterations are done until we reach the 6174 constant

Something like:

``-> (2100 - 12) = 2088 -> (8820 - 288) = 8532 -> (8532 - 2358) = 6174 -> 3 iterations``
